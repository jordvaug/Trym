# Trym
Django backend, MySQL database, React frontend todo app.

#To get started:

1.	Open a virtual environment using the pipenv command: pipenv shell
2.	Next cd into the backend folder and run the server with: python manage.py runserver
3.	Using a new terminal (I use git bash) navigate to the client folder inside the client folder and start the frontend using: npm start
4.	Testing can be run using the command: “pytest” in the root directory in a powershell terminal.
5.	To test the react frontend navigate to the client folder and run command: npm start
6.	To run the postman test, install postman, and then click the link in the github readme. It will show tests for all CRUD endpoints and pass/fail tests for each.
7.	The Django backend is written using Django admin, so the API can be interacted with through that framework. With the server running navigate to: http://localhost:8000/admin and sign in with the credential at the bottom of this page.
8.	Backend documentation can be found at: http://localhost:8000/admin/docs
